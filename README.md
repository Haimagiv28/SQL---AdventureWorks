# SQL-AdventureWorks
## introduction
SQL-AdventureWorks is a SQL project i worked on during Data Analyst cousre.
The project deals with 3 research questions:
  1. Is there seasonality in sales?
  2. Is there similarity between months and years during 2011 - 2014 ? (The years of the company activity)
  3. Are the best-selling products the most profitable?  

In order to solve the research questions, I used the following tools:
  1. Microsoft SQL server.
  2. Ecxel.

In order to present the data analysis in a beautiful and convenient way, I used graphs that present the information in a simple and convenient way.
You are invited to enter the SQL files to view the analysis of the data, and enter the PowerPoint presentation to view the data analisyst, the conclusions and insights.
